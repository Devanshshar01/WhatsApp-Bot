# 🧪 WhatsApp Bot Testing Guide

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS

**Bot is running and waiting for QR scan!**

- Server: ✅ Running on port 3000
- Health API: ✅ Working at http://localhost:3000/health
- QR Code: ⏳ Waiting for scan

## 📱 IMMEDIATE STEPS

### 1. Scan QR Code NOW
- Look at your terminal - QR code is displayed
- Open WhatsApp on your phone
- Go to: **Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**
- Scan the QR code

### 2. Wait for Confirmation
You should see in terminal:
```
[AUTH] Authentication successful!
[READY] ✅ WhatsApp Bot is ready!
```

### 3. Test Commands
**IMPORTANT**: Send these from a DIFFERENT WhatsApp account:

```
/ping      → Should reply: "🏓 Pong! Bot is working perfectly! ✅"
/help      → Shows all available commands
/status    → Shows bot status
/time      → Shows current time
/joke      → Tells a random joke
```

## 🔍 Quick Verification

### Check if bot is ready:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Not Ready Response:**
```json
{"status":"not ready","timestamp":"..."}
```

**Ready Response:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL POINTS

### Why Bot Wasn't Responding Before:

1. **Same Account Issue**: You were testing from the SAME WhatsApp account that scanned the QR. The bot can't respond to itself!

2. **Solution**: You MUST test from:
   - A friend's phone
   - A different WhatsApp account
   - Another phone number

### Working Files:

- **✅ USE**: `bot-server.js` (FULLY WORKING VERSION)
- **❌ DON'T USE**: `index.js` (has issues)

## 🚀 Running the Bot

### Best Way:
```bash
node bot-server.js
```

### Alternative:
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Production (PM2):
```bash
pm2 start bot-server.js --name whatsapp-bot
pm2 logs
```

## 📊 Live Monitoring

Watch messages in real-time:
```bash
# In terminal running bot - you'll see:
[MESSAGE] {...}           # Every message received
[CMD] Processing /ping    # Command processing
[CMD] /ping response sent # Response sent
```

## 🎯 Test Checklist

- [ ] QR Code scanned
- [ ] Bot shows "READY" in terminal
- [ ] Health check returns "healthy"
- [ ] `/ping` works from different account
- [ ] `/help` shows command list
- [ ] Auto-reply works for normal messages

## 🔧 If Not Working

### QR Code Issues:
```bash
# Stop bot (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .wwebjs_auth
node bot-server.js
```

### Check Logs:
```bash
# Watch console output for:
[MESSAGE RECEIVED] ...
[COMMAND] ...
[ERROR] ...
```

### API Test:
```bash
# Send message via API (after bot is ready)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "number": "919876543210",
    "message": "Test from API"
  }'
```

## 📝 Summary
