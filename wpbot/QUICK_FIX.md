# Quick Fix Guide - Bot Not Responding

## Your bot has been fixed! Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Update Your Phone Number
Edit the `.env` file in the `wpbot` folder:

```bash
# Open the .env file
cd wpbot
nano .env   # or use any text editor
```

Change this line to YOUR phone number (without + or spaces):
```
OWNER_NUMBERS=919205201448
```

For example, if your WhatsApp number is +91 9876543210, use:
```
OWNER_NUMBERS=919876543210
```

### Step 2: Restart the Bot

```bash
# Make sure you're in the wpbot directory
cd wpbot

# Stop the bot if it's running (press Ctrl+C)

# Start it again
npm start
```

### Step 3: Scan QR Code
Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp app when it appears.

### Step 4: Wait for Ready Message
Wait until you see: `✅ WhatsApp Bot is ready!`

### Step 5: Test Commands

Send these commands to the bot (in WhatsApp):

**Everyone can use these:**
- `/ping` - Check if bot is alive
- `/help` - Show all commands
- `/about` - Bot information

**Only admins can use these (in groups):**
- `/tagall` - Tag all members
- `/groupinfo` - Group information
- `/promote` - Promote member
- `/demote` - Demote admin

**Only bot owner can use these:**
- `/broadcast` - Send to all groups
- `/block` - Block a user
- `/unblock` - Unblock a user

## Still Not Working?

### Check 1: Is your number correct?
When the bot receives a message, it logs something like:
```
Command detected from 919205201448@c.us: /help
```

The number before `@c.us` should match your `OWNER_NUMBERS` in `.env`

### Check 2: Are you using the correct prefix?
Default prefix is `/` (slash)

So commands should be:
- `/help` ✓
- `help` ✗ (missing prefix)

### Check 3: Check the logs
When you send a command, you should see:
```
Command detected from <your-number>: <your-command>
Executing command: <command-name> with args: <arguments>
```

If you see "This command requires admin privileges":
- In groups: You need to be a WhatsApp group admin
- OR your number must be in `OWNER_NUMBERS` in `.env`
