About The Project
This Spotify Web Clone project was created to develop practical skills in web development by replicating a popular music streaming platform. The motivation was to understand UI/UX design, media control APIs, and responsive layout techniques. The project solves the problem of creating a seamless, interactive music experience on the web, and it helped deepen knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript fundamentals.
